# Generative Market Simulator — GANs & Diffusion for Synthetic Time Series

This project focuses on **deep generative models** for financial markets, creating synthetic price series and regimes.

## 🎯 Goal

Use modern generative models to:
- Simulate realistic return series
- Capture different regimes (calm vs. stress)
- Provide scenarios for backtesting and risk analysis

## 🧱 Planned Components

- GAN- or diffusion-based time series generator (PyTorch)
- Regime-aware modeling and conditioning
- Metrics for realism and calibration
- Use cases:
  - Strategy robustness checks
  - Stress testing and scenario design

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python, PyTorch
- pandas, NumPy
- (Possibly) tslearn / specialized time series tools

This project lives at the intersection of **deep learning**, **risk**, and **market modeling**.
