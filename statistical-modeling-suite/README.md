# Statistical Modeling Suite

A curated collection of compact, rigorous statistical modeling projects.

## 🎯 Focus Areas

- Logistic regression from scratch
- Bayesian regression with Gibbs sampling
- ARMA / ARCH family models
- Maximum likelihood estimators in Python & R

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python, R
- NumPy, pandas, statsmodels
- rstan / brms or similar (for Bayesian modules)

The aim is to show **mathematical maturity** and **modeling clarity**, not just black-box ML.
