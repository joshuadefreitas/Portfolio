# 🧠 Joshua de Freitas  
### Data Scientist · Quantitative Analytics Engineer · AI Systems Builder  

This portfolio collects the work I do across **deep learning**, **market microstructure**, **forecasting**, and **data engineering** – with a strong interest in **quantitative finance** and **econometric modeling**. Everything is crafted in production-ready code. 
Feel free to explore my work and test it out!

# 🚀 Featured Projects

## 1. Time Series Forecasting – Remittances to Mexico  
A full SARIMA-based forecasting study of monthly remittance flows to Mexico, from exploration and diagnostics to uncertainty discussion.  
**Focus:** Econometric time series, model diagnostics, scenario thinking  
**Tools:** R, forecast, stats, ggplot2
